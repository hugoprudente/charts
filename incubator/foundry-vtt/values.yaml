## @section Container felddy/foundryvtt-docker customizations
## @param container.cache Path to use when downloading or fetching already existing download
## @param container.gid `GID` The daemon will be run under. Default is `foundry`
## @param container.patches Set a path to a directory of shell scripts to be sourced after Foundry is installed but before it is started. The path should be in /data or another persistent mount point in the container. e.g.; /data/container_patches Patch files are sourced in lexicographic order. CONTAINER_PATCHES are processed after CONTAINER_PATCH_URLS.
## @param container.patchUrls Set to a space-delimited list of URLs to be sourced after Foundry is installed but before it is started. Patch URLs are sourced in the order specified. CONTAINER_PATCH_URLS are processed before CONTAINER_PATCHES. ⚠️ Only use patch URLs from trusted sources!
## @param container.preserveConfig Normally new `options.json` and `admin.txt` files are generated by the container at each startup.  Setting this to `true` prevents the container from modifying these files when they exist.  If they do not exist, they will be created as normal. Default is false.
## @param container.preserveOwner Normally the ownership of the `/data` directory and its contents are changed to match that of the server at startup.  Setting this to a regular expression will exclude any matching paths and preserve their ownership.   _Note: This is a match on the whole path, not a search._  This is useful if you want mount a volume as read-only inside `/data`
## @param container.timezone Container [TZ database name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). Default is UTC
## @param container.uid `UID` the daemon will be run under. Default is `foundry`
## @param container.verbose Set to `true` to enable verbose logging for the container utility scripts. Default is false
container:
  ## Set a different path to cache downloads of the Foundry distribution archive and speed up subsequent container startups. From v9.255.1 and v10.260.1 the /data/container_cache is created by default this is now enable by default to keep it consistent.
  cache: /data/container_cache

  ## `gid` the deamon will be run under. Default is `foundry`
  gid: 421

  ## Set a path to a directory of shell scripts to be sourced after Foundry is installed but before it is started. The path should be in /data or another persistent mount point in the container. e.g.; /data/container_patches Patch files are sourced in lexicographic order. CONTAINER_PATCHES are processed after CONTAINER_PATCH_URLS.
  patches: /data/patches

  ## Set to a space-delimited list of URLs to be sourced after Foundry is installed but before it is started. Patch URLs are sourced in the order specified. CONTAINER_PATCH_URLS are processed before CONTAINER_PATCHES. ⚠️ Only use patch URLs from trusted sources!
  patchUrls: []
    # - https://www.path.example/z.sh
    # - https://www.path.example/b.sh

  ## Normally new `options.json` and `admin.txt` files are generated by the container at each startup.  Setting this to `true` prevents the container from modifying these files when they exist.  If they do not exist, they will be created as normal. Default is false.
  preserveConfig: false

  ## Normally the ownership of the `/data` directory and its contents are changed to match that of the server at startup.  Setting this to a regular expression will exclude any matching paths and preserve their ownership.   _Note: This is a match on the whole path, not a search._  This is useful if you want mount a volume as read-only inside `/data`
  preserveOwner:

  ## Container [TZ database name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). Default is UTC
  timezone: UTC

  ## `uid` the daemon will be run under. Default is `foundry`
